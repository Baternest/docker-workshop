# Try it!

1. Prepare an HTML file `index.html` at current directory.

--
2. Run an Nginx container:

   ```bash
   $ docker run -d --name nginx   \
        -p 10081:80               \
        -v $(pwd):/usr/share/nginx/html:ro  \
        nginx:1.9.0
   ```

--
3. Try to access it!

   ```bash
   $ curl  localhost:10081
   ```

--
4. Or, use your favorite browser from the host machine!

---

# ... or, try it with Docker Compose

1. the same
2. Run an Nginx container with Docker Compose:

   ```yaml
   nginx:
       image: nginx:1.9.0
       ports:
           - 10081:80
       volumes:
           - .:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro

Principle #3
# daemon off

class: center, middle

TL;DR
# **Avoid "daemonize" yourself**
--

## Stay foreground in your app.
## Let Docker do necessary daemonize stuff for you.

---

class: center, middle

# What is "daemonize"?

---

# Typical daemon program will:

- Close all open file descriptors (especially standard input, standard output and standard error)
- Change its working directory to the root filesystem, to ensure that it doesn’t tie up another filesystem and prevent it from being unmounted
- Reset its umask value
- Run in the background (i.e., fork)
- Disassociate from its process group (usually a shell), to insulate itself from signals (such as HUP) sent to the process group
- Ignore all terminal I/O signals
- Disassociate from the control terminal (and take steps not to reacquire one)
- Handle any SIGCLD signals

# Avoid "daemonize" yourself

> Twelve-factor app processes .red[should never daemonize or write PID files]. Instead, rely on the operating system’s process manager (such as Upstart...) to manage output streams, respond to crashed processes, and handle user-initiated restarts and shutdowns.

# Avoid "daemonize" yourself

> Programs meant to be run under supervisor .red[should not daemonize themselves]. Instead, they .red[should run in the foreground]. They .red[should not detach from the terminal] from which they are started.

# To daemonize or not to daemonize...

- "Daemon off" mode (correct!)

  ```yaml
  FROM  nginx:1.9.0
  CMD [ "nginx", "-g", "daemon off;" ]
  ```

--
- "Daemonize" mode (wrong!)

  ```yaml
  FROM  nginx:1.9.0
